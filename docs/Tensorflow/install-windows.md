# Instructions

We will be installing Tensorflow 2, with GPU support (Nvidia GPU's w/ CUDA) on windows. Today, since the [Container option](install-container.md] does not support the CUDA features we need, we will not use that. When that does, that will be the reccommend path.

## Windows Pre-Req's

- Visual Studio 

## Tensorflow Pre-Req's

- Lots of Nvidia stuff
- Python

## Tensorflow install itself

## Testing our Install
